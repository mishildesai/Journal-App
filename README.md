# Journal App

An app for journaling to improve general well-being.

## Prerequisites 

- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) is installed correctly. Run `flutter doctor` in the console to confirm this.
- [Android Virtual Device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) or [Personal Android device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) with debugging enabled is connected and online. 

## Running the app

- Ensure that you are in the project directory.
- `flutter run` will run the app in debug mode with the development server enabled. This server is used to debug the app by setting breakpoints or catching exceptions.
- `flutter build apk` will build the app in debug mode and create an APK file. This can then be installed on a device.
